# Basic Pokedex
This repository was created for the purpose of allowing students to create a basic Pokédex web application.

## Overview
EXPECTATION: You will be expected to fully engage during lecture periods. Accordingly, please wait until the designated times during this live workshop to code along with your instructor! 

NEED HELP? Practice developing your autonomy as a programmer. Use Google Search, Medium, Hackernoon. MDN, Stack Overflow, peruse documentation at mdn.io, or talk to your friendly neighbor. If you're utterly stuck, flag down your instructor for guidance.

DISCLAIMER: Completion of this workshop is no guarantee of admission into the Hack Reactor immersive program, nor does it have any influence in the admissions process.

## Applying JavaScript Fundamentals

### Creating a project
In order to truly master a programming language, a programmer must use all of the individuals pieces of the language to figure out what the language is capable of. Mastery of a language does not necessarily mean that you've commited every single interface of the language to memory but you do have an idea about what is possible within the language, what are the strengths of the language, and what is the best reference material for researching the language when you're not sure what a particular interface might do.

### Workshop Expectations
You may or may not understand every single aspect of every single line of code you are writing and seeing in this workshop. The workshop instructor and the slides are here to help you figure out what each of the lines are doing but deep understanding will only come from stepping through the code one self with documentation nearby.

### JavaScript Documentation
One of the best JavaScript reference manuals on the web is located at the [MDN Web Docs Website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). Use the search bar at the top to search any piece of JavaScript code that you aren't familiar with.


### Vocabulary Development

Developing your vocabulary as a programmer is as important as learning to write code. To accelerate your conversational capabilities, we recommend partnering with a neighbor to discuss your code at every opportunity. The more opportunities you have to explain yourself, the better. Don't worry – with time, you'll know all the jargon there is to know about programming.
